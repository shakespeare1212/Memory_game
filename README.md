# Memory_game
Based on this open source project:  https://github.com/kubowania/memory-game.  This redo uses differ art work. It renames this image files in a more generic way. It uses different colors for the background, and it uses "timeout" messages to communicate with the player, instead of alert boxes. The cards also flip back over on their own.
